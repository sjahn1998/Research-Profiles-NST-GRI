<b>Abstract</b>: In this study, we measure the accumulated research achievements of government-funded research institutes(GRIs) under National Research Council of Science & Technology(NST) objectively by applying scientometric methodology and examine the R&D level of GRIs by comparing with the global levels. For this, the core indicators were calculated using the i-Metrics system of Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information(KISTI). We used SCOPUS DB and collected the bibliographic information of articles published for the past 10 years(2009-2018) of foreign GRIs such as Max Planck Society of Germany, CNRS of France, and so on. The indicator combination frame was designed for the effective comparative analysis between the calculated index, and the indicator combination map which is made with number of publications, excellent paper rate and international collaboration rate was constructed. Particularly, this study differentiated from previous research results analysis focusing on the journal citation impact factor by using the normalized indicators that reflect the unique characteristics of each field and measure the influence of individual articles. Also, we explored for the benchmarking institutions of GRIs through the analysis of the research profiles of GRIs and the foreign research institutes and analyzed the gap between the benchmarking institutions and the GRIs through their comparative analysis. It is expected that these findings can be used to diagnose objective competences and to set the research directions appropriate for roles and responsibilities of GRIs.
